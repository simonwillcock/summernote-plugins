A Summernote Plugin Collection
-------------------------------

These are plugins I've developed while using the [Summernote WYSIWYG editor](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/).

Some of these will work for everyone, while others rely on custom dialogs used in my work's inhouse CMS and so might only be useful as a source of inspiration.
